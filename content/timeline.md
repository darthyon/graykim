# Timeline

## 1995—2013: The Black Sheep Years
Born into Kim & Associates. Legacy law firm. The kind where your career gets decided before you learn to walk. Father's a defense attorney. Mother handles the finances. Older brother went corporate law. Younger sister does NGO work and has a decent media following.

Gray was supposed to do law or operations. Follow the plan. Make it easy.

He didn't.

Started teaching himself to code at 14. Family called it a hobby. Refused to pay for courses. Kept telling him to prep for law school.

Gray never went to college. Never took the bar. Just stayed in his room writing code while everyone else did what they were supposed to.

## 2013—2022: Equity Over Salary
Sold his first code at 19. Startup had no money, so they gave him equity instead. He did the work. Backend, frontend, security, infrastructure, whatever needed fixing. Stuck around long enough to finish the job. Left before it felt permanent.

Did it again with a different company. Then again.

First payout covered six months of rent. Second one barely mattered. Third one actually went somewhere. Funding rounds, acquisition talks, all of it. Gray cashed out at 27 with enough to do something stupid.

## 2022: That Bar Opens
Bought a building nobody wanted. Plumbing was a disaster. Wiring was worse. Neon sign flickered like it was dying. His friends said don't do it.

He spent six months fixing what he could and pretending the rest didn't exist. Opened it anyway.

People showed up. The right ones.

His mother sent flowers opening night. His father didn't come. His brother called it bold. His sister put something on Instagram that didn't really say anything.

Gray kept the flowers for a couple weeks. Tossed the card.

## 2024: The Night the Cops Came
Year two. Someone he trusted started selling things they shouldn't have been selling. Not dangerous, just illegal enough to matter. Got loud about it. Cops showed up.

Gray gave them what they wanted. Names, routes, enough to keep himself clean and the bar open.

He could've called his father. One call and it all would've gone away. He didn't make the call.

Started the ring system that same week. Black rings for regulars. You triple-tap, security comes. You control the chaos, you control the exit, you control what people know.

What no one knows: the rings record when they're activated. Gray and his team know who to watch. Who might cause problems. Who's worth the risk.

## Family: Once a Year
Christmas card comes every December. Nice paper, family photo, everyone looks happy.

Gray goes back once. Sits through one dinner. Brother talks about his cases. Sister talks about her campaigns. Mom asks if he's still doing the bar thing. Dad doesn't look at him.

He leaves before dessert. Always does.

They don't get why he picked this life. He stopped explaining a long time ago.

## 2025: Still Here
Three years in.

It's not perfect. Pipes still leak, money's still tight, fights still break out. Upstairs is a mess. Needs new chairs, new tables, new lights, new floors, new paint. Needs everything.

But it's his. Built without family money, without investors, without anyone telling him what to do.

Spreadsheets stay open. Numbers are tight but he's still breathing. Still free.

Kingdom built on no sleep, cheap whiskey, money he actually earned, and knowing when to forget what you hear. Also, when to use it when the world is against you.
