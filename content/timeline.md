# Timeline

## 1995—2013: The Black Sheep Years
Born into Kim & Associates. A legacy law firm where your future's drafted before you can read. Father's a defense attorney. Mother runs the books. Older brother does corporate law. Younger sister's into NGO work with a growing media presence.

Gray was supposed to go into law or operations. Expected to follow the script.

He didn't.

Taught himself to code at 14 instead. The family called it a phase. Wouldn't fund courses. Told him to focus on law school prep.

Gray skipped college entirely. Never took the bar exam. Just kept writing code in his room while his siblings checked all the right boxes.

## 2013—2022: Equity Over Salary
Sold his first code at 19. Startup couldn't pay upfront, so he took equity. Did the work—backend, frontend, infrastructure, security, whatever they needed. Stayed long enough to deliver. Left before it turned into a career.

He did it again. Different startup. Same deal. Rinse and repeat, until he cashed out at 27.

First payout covered rent for six months. Second one barely made a dent. Third one actually hit the market hard. There was acquisition, funding rounds, the whole thing. Gray walked away with enough money to make a risky, impulsive (some may say stupid) decision.

## 2022: That Bar Opens
Bought a run-down building. Bad plumbing. Worse wiring. Neon sign that worked maybe half the time. Friends told him it was a terrible idea.

Gray spent six months fixing what he could, ignoring what he couldn't. DIY'd the rest. Opened anyway.

The right people found it.

His mother sent flowers on opening night. His father didn't show. His brother said it was "bold." His sister posted something vague on Instagram.

Gray kept the flowers for a few weeks. Didn't keep the card.

## 2024: The Night the Cops Came
Year two. Someone Gray vouched for started selling things they shouldn't have. Nothing too dangerous, but just illegal enough. And a big commotion notified the cops.

They came knocking.

Gray negotiated. Gave names. Routes. Just enough to keep the bar open and himself out of trouble.

He could've called his father. One phone call would've made it disappear. He didn't.

The ring system started that same week. Matte-black rings for regulars. Triple-tap if you need security. Control the chaos. Control the exit. Control the information. No one knows that when activated, the ring also records. No one knows that Gray and his team is aware of who has the potential of making shady deals and who to keep their eyes on.

## Family: Once a Year
They send a Christmas card every December. Expensive paper. Family photo. Everyone smiling.

Gray goes back once a year. Sits through dinner. His brother talks about cases. His sister talks about campaigns. His mother asks if he's "still running that place." His father doesn't look at him.

Gray leaves before dessert. Every time.

They don't understand why he chose this. He stopped trying to explain.

## 2025: Still Here
Three years in.

The bar's not perfect. Pipes still leak. Margins are tight. He still has to break off the bar fights. The upstairs needs work, new chairs, new tables, new lighting, new flooring, new paint, new everything. But it's his. No family money. No investors. No board meetings.

Spreadsheets always open. Numbers are tight but he is breathing through his freedom.

Kingdom built on sleepless nights, alcohol, well-earned money, and knowing when to forget what you heard. Also, when to use it when the world is against you.
