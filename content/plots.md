## Upstairs in the Dark
**EDGE THREAD** | Someone's upstairs. Alone. Sitting in the dark. They're not breaking rules. Not causing problems. Just there. Gray goes up to check. They don't explain. Gray doesn't ask. Now they're both just sitting.

## The One from Before
**EDGE THREAD** | Someone from childhood walks in. Or maybe they know the family. They don't get why Gray walked away from the law firm, the trust fund, the name. They think he's being stubborn. Or they assume he's got family money backing the bar. Then they mention the night the police came. Gray does not appreciate that.

## The Ring Request
**EDGE THREAD** | Someone asks Gray for a ring. They've been coming for months. Never caused trouble. Know the vibe. Gray says no. Doesn't explain why. Maybe he doesn't want them exposed to what happens upstairs on weekends. All kinds of things go down. Maybe he wants to keep them separate from that. Or maybe he just doesn't trust them enough yet.

## 3AM Argument
**SOFT THREAD** | Two people get into it at the bar. Voices rising. Other patrons watching. Gray lets it play out for a bit—sometimes people need to get it out. But it's escalating. He steps in. Now he's the one they're both looking at.

## The Hot and Cold Regular
**CULT CLASSIC** | The banter's always sharp. Chemistry's obvious. Everyone at the bar notices. Something happened between them—maybe a line got crossed, maybe both of them stepped over it. Neither's acknowledging it. Some nights the tension's electric. Other nights it's ice. Gray's not sure which is worse.

## The Repeated Offender
**EDGE THREAD** | Someone's been crashing at Gray's loft after drinking too much. Third time this month. Gray's pissed. He doesn't run a hostel. But he keeps letting it happen. And he's starting to realize he cares more than he should.

## Daylight Encounter
**SOFT THREAD** | Gray runs into someone outside the bar. Maybe at the coffee shop after surfing. Maybe at the gym. Maybe grabbing brunch somewhere he doesn't usually go. It's weird seeing each other in daylight. Normal clothes. No alcohol. No neon. Just two people who usually only exist at night.

## Closing Time Confession
**SOFT THREAD** | Last call's done. Chairs are up. Gray's wiping down the bar. One person's still there, lingering by the door. They've got something to say but can't seem to get it out. Gray's tired. But he's listening.

## The Receipts Come Back
**CULT CLASSIC** | Someone's been collecting Gray's receipt notes. Tonight, they bring them all in—dozens of them, organized, dated. They want to know what they mean. Gray doesn't remember writing half of them. The other half? He's not sure he wants to explain.
