## Plot Guidelines

**Intensity:** ⚡ = Low (chill, quiet) | ⚡⚡ = Medium (tension, drama) | ⚡⚡⚡ = High (chaos, unhinged)

These are conversation starters—something to kick things off. They might change completely once we start plotting, and I'm very much open to that. Got your own ideas? Even better. Let's talk.

---

## Rooftop in the Dark
⚡

Someone's on the rooftop. Alone. Sitting in the dark. They're not breaking rules. Not causing problems. Just there. Gray goes up to check. Now they're both just standing with their drinks in one hand. (thinking of random, deep conversations)

## The One from Before
⚡⚡

Someone from his childhood walks in. Your muse probably know his family. They don't get why Gray walked away from the law firm, the trust fund, the name. Or they assume he's got family money backing the bar. They started reminiscing about the 'good' old days. Gray does not appreciate that.

## The Ring Request
⚡

Someone asks Gray for a ring. They've been coming for months. Never caused trouble. Gray says no. Doesn't explain why. Maybe he doesn't want them exposed to what happens upstairs on weekends. All kinds of things go down. Or maybe he just doesn't trust them enough yet.

## 3AM Argument
⚡⚡

Two people get into it at the bar. Voices rising. Other patrons watching. Gray lets it play out for a bit. Sometimes people need to get it out of their system. But it's escalating. Gray steps in but it is too late.

## The Hot and Cold Regular
⚡⚡⚡

The banter's always sharp. Chemistry's obvious. Something happened between them. Maybe a line got crossed, maybe both of them stepped over it. Some nights the tension's electric. Tonight it's ice. (could be more, need to explore)

## The Repeated Offender
⚡

Someone's been crashing at Gray's loft after drinking too much. Third time this month. Gray's pissed. He doesn't run a guest house. But he keeps letting it happen. And he's starting to realize maybe he cared a little too much. (could be more, need to explore)

## Daylight Encounter
⚡

Gray's grabbing oat milk at the corner store when a woman storms up, phone out—"You stole my $800, 'Daniel'!". She slaps him hard. He doesn't flinch, just blinks, confused, receipt still in hand. No running. Just daylight, fluorescent lights, and the sting of someone else's scam.

## Closing Time Confession
⚡

Last call's done. Chairs are up. Gray's wiping down the bar. One person's still there, lingering by the door. They've got something to say but can't seem to get it out. Gray's tired. But he's up for it.

## The Receipts Come Back
⚡⚡

Someone storms in with a fistful of Gray’s receipts. They slam them down on the table, claiming every haiku was a drop code for laced pills, written in Gray’s handwriting. But it wasn’t Gray. Your muse could be someone who is related to victims of this person's crime.
