# That Bar

## You Won't Find It on Google
No website. No social media presence. Just concrete, a red neon sign that flickers when it feels like it, and barely any foot traffic unless you already know it's there.

You hear about it through someone who heard about it from someone else. Address gets passed around at 2AM. The people who need to find it, will be at the doors eventually.

## Downstairs - Main Floor
Dim. Red neon glow. Exposed brick that's probably older than Gray. Leather booths that look like they've been through some things but still hold up.

Music's quiet. Jazz, blues, sometimes nothing. Just people talking low and glasses clinking.

Closes at 3AM on weekdays. Time stops making sense once you're in here. People come to forget things. Or talk through things. Or just sit without anyone asking questions.

Gray doesn't pour drinks. He hires bartenders who treat it like a craft. Artists, not servers.

## Upstairs - Weekends Only
Private booths. Darker than downstairs. Different kind of crowd.

Only open on weekends. Rules are simple: keep it legal, keep it mutual. No phones out. No cameras. No one checking the time. What happens up here doesn't leave.

You need a ring to get in. Matte black, no logos, nothing flashy. Only regulars get them. People who've been around long enough to prove they get it.

Triple-tap the ring on the bar and security shows up. Fast. Doesn't matter if it's trouble or you just need help. Someone won't leave you alone? Done. Medical thing? Handled. Causing problems? You're out before you realize what's happening.

## The Loft - Third Floor
Gray's floor. No one else gets up here.

Everything's gray. Walls, furniture, all of it. One wall's covered in cigarette packs from 47 different countries. Pinned up like he's collecting something that matters.

One shelf has his art. Paintings, sculptures, weird little toys. Nothing you can buy twice. Each one has a story he'll tell you if you're drunk enough to listen. Because that could mean you will not remember much after he is done sharing.

Corner of the rooftop has mint growing. He waters it every morning by hand. Only routine he keeps.

## The Ring System
Started the same week the cops came by.

Matte black rings. No branding. He gives them to people who've been coming long enough to understand how things work.

You triple-tap it on the bar and someone's there in seconds.

Not just for fights. For anything. You're having a medical emergency, bad date, someone won't back off, whatever. The ring means you're covered.

Gray's approach: let things get messy. Just make sure you decide who stays and who goes.

## The Receipts
Gray writes on bar receipts. Random stuff. Quotes he half remembers, questions that don't have answers, things that sound deep at 2AM.

He slides them to people. Strangers, regulars, whoever's sitting there. Sometimes it makes sense. Most times it doesn't.

People keep them. Put them in frames. Post photos online. Spend hours trying to figure out what he meant.

Gray doesn't explain anything. Doesn't even remember writing half of them. Doesn't think he needs to.
